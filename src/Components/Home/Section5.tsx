            DAMASCUS IS A WELL-KNOWN STYLE OF STEEL THAT IS DISTINGUISHABLE BY ITS CONTRASTING MARBLE LIGHT AND DARK DESIGN.  THERE ARE TWO TYPES OF DAMASCUS STEEL (CAST DAMASCUS STEEL AND PATTERN-WELDED DAMASCUS STEEL).  ALTHOUGH SIMILAR LOOKING, THEY ARE FORGED THROUGH VERY SPECIFIC AND DIFFERENT PROCESSES. HISTORICALLY, DAMASCUS STEEL WAS ALWAYS PRIZED FOR ITS BEAUTY, AS WELL AS ABILITY TO KEEP A SHARP EDGE WHILE REMAINING STRONG AND FLEXIBLE. SEEN AS THE “STEEL OF ANCIENTS”, ARMS MADE OF DAMASCUS STEEL ARE SUPERIOR TO THOSE MADE OF IRON. DAMASCUS CRAFTSMANSHIP GAINED A REPUTATION OF NEAR MAGICAL PROPERTIES AND WITH ONLY A PRECIOUS FEW THAT KNEW HOW TO ACHIEVE THIS, IT WOULD BECOME A PRECIOUS PIECE OF HISTORY FOR ANY ARMS ENTHUSIAST.
