    For orders over R1000 we will ship free of charge within South Africa. Delivery will be door-to-door and packages are generally dispatched within 1 working day after receipt of payment. Parcels are shipped via The Courier Guy with tracking and drop-off signature. We will provide you with a link to track your package online. In some cases, we may change the courier if the selected does not deliver in your area. 
    </Typography><br/>
    <Typography gutterBottom variant="body1">
    Shipping fees include handling and packing fees as well as courier charge. These fees are fixed, and we charge a flat rate nationwide for order under a R1000. We advise you to group your items in one order. We cannot group two distinct orders placed separately, and shipping fees will apply to each of them. Your package will be dispatched at your own risk, but special care is taken to protect fragile objects.

    Should you receive your parcel in a damaged state, please contact us immediately. We strongly advise that you open the parcel in the presence of the courier’s representative and take photos of the damaged parcel (packaging and products) to assist with resolving the issue. We will never ship broken items and/or damaged packaging.

    <Typography gutterBottom variant="body1">
    All other parcels will be shipped via an economy service. Delivery will be within 2-6 working days.
